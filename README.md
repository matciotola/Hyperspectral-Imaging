# Sparsity Constrained Optimization

----

`Sparsity Constrained Optimization (SCO)` is a class of nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems with l0 norm constraints, which has been proven critical in many fields, such as signal and image processing, machine learning, and engineering. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me !
