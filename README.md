# Sparsity Constrained Optimization

`Outlier Detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection>`_
(also known as *Anomaly Detection*) is an exciting yet challenging field,
which aims to identify outlying objects that are deviant from the general data distribution.
Outlier detection has been proven critical in many fields, such as credit card
fraud analytics, network intrusion detection, and mechanical unit defect detection.

This repository collects:


#. Books & Academic Papers 
#. Online Courses and Videos
#. Outlier Datasets
#. Open-source and Commercial Libraries/Toolkits
#. Key Conferences & Journals


**More items will be added to the repository**.
Please feel free to suggest other key resources by opening an issue report,
submitting a pull request, or dropping me an email @ (zhaoy@cmu.edu).
Enjoy reading!
